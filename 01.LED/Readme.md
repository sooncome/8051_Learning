# Basic of 8051 IC  
8051 IC, for 40-DIP type, have 4set of GPIO (P0 ~ P4), total of 4*8(P0.0~P0.7)=32 GPIO
## GPIO Introduce
### P0 Port
Port that without pull-up resistor (open-drain), when output HIHG require a extern pull-up resistor
### P1 ~ P4
Port that with pull-up resistor, can output HIGH normally

# 1st try to Program MCU
### Light up LED
which means to control GPIO to output HIGH or LOW
